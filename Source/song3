If I were a boy Even just for one day
I' roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys and chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Because they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone its broken
So they think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home £¨to come home£©
If I were a boy I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late
for you to come back
Say its just a mistake
Think I forgive you like that
If you thought I would
wait for you you thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
£¨yea you don'tunderstand£©
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish will a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
you lose the one you wanted
you've taken her for granted
you lose the one you wanted
you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
