I let it fall my heart
我的心在下坠
And as it fell you rose to claim it

It was dark and I was over
天昏地暗 我万念俱灰
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
直到你亲吻我的双唇 拯救了我
My hands they're strong
我的双手强劲有力
But my knees were far too weak
双膝却软弱无依
To stand in your arms
依偎在你的怀中
Without falling to your feet
而不是倒在你的脚下
But there's a side to you
但是你有一面
That I never knew never knew
我从未知晓 全然不知
All the things you'd say
你说过的话
They were never true never true
全是谎言 从未真实
And the games you play
爱情游戏里
You would always win always win
你永远是赢家  一贯如此
But I set fire to the rain
我在雨中燃起熊熊烈火
Watched it pour as I touched your face
我轻抚着你的脸颊 大雨滂沱
Well it burned while I cried
雨在烧 我在哭
Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name

When I lay with you
与你共枕之时
I could stay there
我方可停留
Close my eyes
闭上双眼?
Feel you're here forever
感觉好像你永远在我身边
You and me together

Nothing gets better
此情无与伦比
Cause there's a side to you
但是你有一面
That I never knew never knew

They were never true never true
全是谎言 从未真实
And the games you play
爱情游戏里
You would always win always win

But I set fire to the rain

Watched it pour as I touched your face
